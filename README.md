# Memoria Web Prototype

## Overview
This project is a simple web prototype built during my early schooling. It uses the Archive.org API to fetch and display a side-by-side comparison of how websites look today versus how they looked 10 years ago. The front end is basic, and the focus was on learning how to work with APIs and build functional prototypes.
